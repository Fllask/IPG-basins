# Summary
This repository stores the code used for the Optimization for Machine learning course. The file are organized in the following way:
- game_definition.py define the game structure, note that a dynamic game is defined despite not appearing in the report: indeed, the analysis of the stage game alone was complete enough
- algorithms.py define the gradient descent algorithms. One can see that again, more algorithm where defined than analysed in the report (stochastic gradient descent for both stage and dynamic game, for example)
- run.ipynb can be run to reproduce all figures that appear in the report.

## Authors:
This code was exclusively written by Gabriel Vallat
